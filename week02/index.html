				What struck me most when reading "As We May Think" is that this was written in 1945 by Vannevar Bush and still remains extremely relevant today. In this text, Bush dicusses all the recent technology that has been developed due to the war. He expresses concern for the direction of scientific efforts towards violence and destruction, rather than gaining knowledge. In the context of World War 2, this makes perfect sense, but it is rather scary how applicable this is to today's times. Especially with seeing how much technology has expanded since then, it really brings into question the ethics behind most modern technology. Today, so much of America's federal budget is funding the military when we are not even actively at war with any country, while we most definitely have the technology to be fixing other more social issues. It really puts into perspective what the priorities of these scientists and politicians are. Bush also discusses the way in which technology should be used. He discusses how we should be using technology to "extend the human memory and the human ability to catalogue, catergorize, and recollect the totality of human information." I find it very interesting that it seems as if he is almost describing the Internet. Little would he know the types of issues that could arise
				from a public domain that could carry so much knowledge.

				Long Live the Web </h2>

I liked how the are two very different commodities. The Web is an application that runs on the Internet, while the Internet is an "electronic network that transmits packets of information among millions of computers according to a few open protocols." He discusses how the separation between the two are "crucial for innovation." Additonally, Berner-Lee discusses the importance of not letting the web's evolution get in the hands of any one person or organization. This is particularly relevant to today because it is seemingly evident that companies like Google and Facebook are practically monopolizing the web. They have bought out so many smaller companies to the point where they truly hold so much power. It is almost horrifying how much data they potentially have on all of their users, yet the government are not as well verses with such new technology and therefore don't know what rules should be set in place. We are definitely living during very murky times of technology regulation.
